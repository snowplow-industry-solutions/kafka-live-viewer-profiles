== Testing

=== Running unit tests

. It's simple (and these tests are also called when building the Docker container). Just type:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./gradlew clean build
----
+
NOTE: Maybe `KafkaConsumerServiceTest` should be considered an integration test.
But since it runs by automatically creating an `EmbeddedKafkaBroker` by `SpringBootTest`, it does not require an active server.
So, this test runs like any other ordinary unit test.

=== Running integration tests

. Currently, these are the available integration test classes:
+
[,console]
----
$ find . -type f -name '*IntegrationTest.java'
./src/test/java/com/snowplowanalytics/liveviewerprofile/service/KafkaConsumerServiceIntegrationTest.java
./src/test/java/com/snowplowanalytics/liveviewerprofile/repository/VideoEventRepositoryIntegrationTest.java
----

==== Testing `KafkaConsumerServiceIntegrationTest`

. Start Kafka:
+
[,console]
----
$ ../docker/compose.sh up kafka-services
----
+
. Run the following command:
+
[,console]
----
$ test_cases=KafkaConsumerServiceIntegrationTest ./run-integration-tests.sh
----
+
TIP: You can pass the `--info` parameter to this script in order to get more details while running it.

==== Testing `VideoEventRepositoryIntegrationTest`

. Start LocalStack:
+
[,console]
----
$ ../docker/compose.sh up localstack
----
+
. Run the following command:
+
[,console]
----
$ test_cases=VideoEventRepositoryIntegrationTest ./run-integration-tests.sh
----

==== Testing all

. If you already started the services required for each test, you can also type:
+
[,console]
----
$ ./run-instegration-tests.sh
----
